In case you want to build a traditional backend system, if you stick with AWS you are on a lucky. AWS not only provides <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">lambdas</a> where you code can run your code but also provides an integration with the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\">API gateway</a>, which makes the development of RESTful APIs much easier.</p>\n<p>If you want to use a database on your service, AWS also provides multiple serverless solutions. If you prefer a NoSQL approach, you have the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\">DynamoDB</a>, which in terms of configurability itâ€™s probably the easier solution. On the other hand, if your use case is not good for NoSQL, AWS also provide the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/\">Aurora DB</a>, through RDS. If you have doubts about which approach itâ€™s better for you, go check this <a href=\"https://www.serverless.com/blog/choosing-a-database-with-serverless\">article</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to all of this, you also can take advantage of the <a href=\"https://www.serverless.com/\">serverless framework</a>, which letâ€™s you write definitions, of the previous mention resources, through code (more specifically, in YAML format). This way, all you need to create and deploy your infrastructure is a file of code (or multiple, depending on your preference ðŸ˜„).</p>\n<h2>The architecture</h2>\n<p>After the previous explanations, the only thing that we are missing to choose to our promo codes system, is the database. I will not enter in business logic details, but for the use case I was aiming, a SQL approach was the best one. I had multiple filters, pagination, and sorts (since the service would serve a back office application), so the database chosen was the Aurora DB.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s worth mentioning that, in a previous version, this service had itâ€™s own authentication system to validate, create and refresh JWT tokens. But, currently, only validates tokens, which should be generated by an external service.</p>\n<p>In terms of API, as mentioned, the service allows to create, update, and validate promo codes. While not putting the full documentation here, both creation and update receive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>owner;</li>\n<li>discount percentage;</li>\n<li>expiration date;</li>\n<li>description;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The API of validate is used when a user tries to use a promo code. This way we can validate if the promo code is still valid (due to the expiration date) and also if the user that is trying to use the promo code is the the owner of it. Here, to know the user that is trying to use the promo code, we use the JWT token passed on the request.</p>\n<p>The architecture diagram can be illustrated as follows:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/09de3220bfa1be343ee6822acc69fa47/5a6dd/architecture.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.06329113924051%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Architecture\"\n        title=\"Architecture\"\n        src=\"/static/09de3220bfa1be343ee6822acc69fa47/f058b/architecture.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/09de3220bfa1be343ee6822acc69fa47/c26ae/architecture.png 158w,\n/static/09de3220bfa1be343ee6822acc69fa47/6bdcf/architecture.png 315w,\n/static/09de3220bfa1be343ee6822acc69fa47/f058b/architecture.png 630w,\n/static/09de3220bfa1be343ee6822acc69fa47/5a6dd/architecture.png 802w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Promo Codes","date":"May 05, 2020","description":"Service that consist of multiple APIs made to be used as a backend for a promo codes service.
